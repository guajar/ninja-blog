					<p>I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. I don't think anybody knows it
					was <strong>Russia</strong> that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be
					Russia, but it could also be <strong>China</strong>...</p>
                    <p><i>You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do</i>. No wonder you've been
                    fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. You could see there was text coming
                    out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. My placeholder text, I think,
                    is going to end up being very good with women.</p>
                    <p>I’m doing very well. <a href="http://trumpsumipsum.com/" class="link-text">Make America Great Again!</a> People that are here, like Hispanics that are against me, 
                    but I’ve had Muslims call and tell me you’re right with them. It's gonna be huge.  I mean, there’s tremendous hatred. 
                    Even the, even the guy they caught in Paris. He was being hid out by other Muslims, and everybody is after him, 
                    and he’s living right next to where he grew up.  There’s a serious, serious problem. People come up to me all the time and ask. 
                    I’ve had many polls that are legally. And I think that just to try and answer your question: Uh, 
                    I am the least racist person that you will ever meet. Okay. That I can tell you. Do you want to know? I'll tell you. 
                    With the Muslim thing, I think I’ll be able to make my  points. It's gonna be huge.  
                    I mean, you know you may think of it as negative. Many people that vote. You're gonna love it. 
                    Like people leaving voting booths and all, I’m doing very well with them. It's gonna be huge.  
                    I mean, you know, you know, you know, but, but I think it</p>
