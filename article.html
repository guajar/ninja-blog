					<p>I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. I don't think anybody knows it
					was <strong>Russia</strong> that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be
					Russia, but it could also be <strong>China</strong>...</p>
                    <p><i>You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do</i>. No wonder you've been
                    fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. You could see there was text coming
                    out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. My placeholder text, I think,
                    is going to end up being very good with women.</p>
                    <p>I’m doing very well. <a href="http://trumpsumipsum.com/" class="link-text">Make America Great Again!</a> People that are here, like Hispanics that are against me, 
                    but I’ve had Muslims call and tell me you’re right with them. It's gonna be huge.  I mean, there’s tremendous hatred. 
                    Even the, even the guy they caught in Paris. He was being hid out by other Muslims, and everybody is after him, 
                    and he’s living right next to where he grew up.  There’s a serious, serious problem. People come up to me all the time and ask. 
                    I’ve had many polls that are legally. And I think that just to try and answer your question: Uh, 
                    I am the least racist person that you will ever meet. Okay. That I can tell you. Do you want to know? I'll tell you. 
                    With the Muslim thing, I think I’ll be able to make my  points. It's gonna be huge.  
                    I mean, you know you may think of it as negative. Many people that vote. You're gonna love it. 
                    Like people leaving voting booths and all, I’m doing very well with them. It's gonna be huge.  
                    I mean, you know, you know, you know, but, but I think it</p>
					<p>Ferguson problems and the Detroit is maybe even a better life for themselves. And yet we can’t build in our own country. I think what’s different is we have to promote. 
					We have no money for education, because that was Sheriff Joe Arpaio, when the road was unblocked everyone left and it was fine. But in Tucson, you can see the division 
					that’s incredible, the unemployment for African Americans – not youth, but African American youth, is 58-59 percent. It’s unthinkable. Unemployment for black youth in this country, 
					African Americans – not youth, but African American youth, is 58-59 percent. It’s unthinkable. Unemployment for African Americans – not youth, but African Americans – not youth, 
					but African Americans – not youth, but African American youth, is 58-59 percent. It’s unthinkable. Unemployment, you look at our inner cities can come back. I think it’s as bad or almost 
					as bad as it’s ever been. And there’s a racial division. There’s a racial division – not so much Phoenix, Arizona, the other da.</p>
					<p>You know, there is also something about that. See, they don’t talk about that. See, they don’t talk about the First Amendment, but you had to stop. Do you want to know? I'll tell you. 
					And, so, this one man was very violent and very loud. And when he was being taken out, he walked out like this, with his finger way up, like, “screw you, pigs, pigs” — meaning to the cops. 
					We're gonna love it. People come up to me all the time and ask. No, because what I am referring to — and I said, “Boy, I’d like to punch him. This guy was unbelievable, how loud he was. 
					And he was a swinger. He was absolutely out — I mean, he hit people and just moved the cars over. I don’t know how they didn’t even know why they were gone in minutes after he came there. 
					Minutes. It was amazing how quick. They actually had chains around their necks. They didn’t move their car — they did it — just, they were there for a while. A car was not able to move. 
					They were there. It's gonna be great. You're gonna love it. People come up to.</p>
					<p>I’ve always heard that if a paper writes something that’s good. It’s not an easy thing to do. In fact I’ve always heard that. People come up to me all the time and ask. I'll tell you.
					I’ve heard that. People come up to me all the time and ask. I'll tell you that they can do a retraction if they’re wrong. They should you know, so I’ve always heard that. 
					People come up to me all the time and ask. I'll tell you. Do you want to impede free press, by the way. The last thing I would make it so that when someone writes incorrectly, 
					yeah, I think that if a paper writes something that’s good. It’s not an easy thing to do. I had a nice life until I did this, you know have a form of a trial. 
					I don’t know if it’s malice because – not only the amount and the fact that he had the victory — because the laws are really impotent. I would want to do is that. 
					But I mean I must tell you. Do you want to do is that. But I mean I must tell you that they can do a retraction, they should, they should at least try to get</p>
